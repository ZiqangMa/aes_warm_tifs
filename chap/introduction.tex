In  practical implementations of a cryptographic algorithm,
   the cryptographic keys could be leaked through  side channels on
    timing \cite{Acii2005Improving,Ac2006Trace,Bonneau2006Cache,Bernstein2005Cache,Gullasch2011Cache,Kocher1996Timing,Neve2006A,Osvik2006Cache,Tsunoo2003Cryptanalysis,Tromer2010Efficient}, % 引用一些在不同的方法上，有开创性的
    electromagnetic fields \cite{Electromagnetic-sidechannel}, power \cite{power-pc,Bertoni2005AES},
 ground electric potential \cite{electric-potential-sidechannel} or acoustic emanations \cite{Acoustic-sidechannel},
  even when the algorithm is semantically secure.
%  Side channel attacks are using these vulnerabilities to obtain the sensitive information.
  Among these vulnerabilities,
   timing side-channel attacks are easily launched without any special devices.
In particular, remote timing side channels allow an attacker without
    any system or physical privilege on the computer,
    to disclose the keys
   only by repeatedly invoking the encryption/decryption functions and measuring the execution time \cite{Tsunoo2002Cryptanalysis,Bernstein2005Cache,Bonneau2006Cache,Neve2006A,Brumley2011Remote,Brumley2005Remote}.
% 公钥算法的timing，也很明显，但是与cache无关？引用remote cache攻击
%Public key algorithms have proved the most vulnerable to timing attacks because they typically perform lengthy mathematical operations, the running time of which depends directly on the data due to branch statements
%Timing side channel attacks are the easiest to be carried out because the time is measured simply and they don't require specialized equipment.
%在AES选举的过程中，认为AES是基于查找表的实现，其是能够抵抗像RSA、ECC这些分支跳转产生的执行时间差异所引入的side channel attack

Remote timing side channels passively exploiting the time difference of data cache misses and hits,
    called \emph{remote cache timing side channels} in this paper,
 are widely found in lots of cryptographic implementations of block ciphers \cite{Ac2007Cache,Bernstein2005Cache,Bonneau2006Cache,Tsunoo2002Cryptanalysis,Tsunoo2003Cryptanalysis,atici2016remote,saraswat2014remote}. % Brumley2011Remote,Brumley2005Remote, 分别是针对ECC 和RSA 的，而且不是针对cache hit or miss的。 广泛存在\cite{}
In these implementations,
  table lookup is the primary time-consuming operation.
Because accessing data in caches is much faster than those in RAM chips,
 cache misses and hits in table lookup
    remarkably influence the overall execution time of block ciphers.
Therefore,
   from the execution time, the attackers are able to infer the inputs of table lookup operations that are determined by the secret keys (and also the plaintext/ciphertext).

%Different inputs of table lookup cause different cache access behavior so that the overall time differs, which are related to the secret keys,    and then the information about keys leaks.

%	Cache timing side channel是指利用密码计算过程中，对于cache/RAM访问而导致的timing特征，获得密钥。在大量的对称密码算法中，有“与key相关的查表操作”，与cache相关；影响到timing。攻击者就可以从timing获得推导密钥信息。
%	Remote side channel是指，攻击者可以远程发起，不需要接触或者近距离在密码系统旁边，也不需要在密码计算机器上有什么操作权限。相比其他的side channel，remote cache timing side channel的攻击条件很低，影响更多。最早是有……攻击[??]，后来又有什么发展。

%Remote timing cache side channels widely exists in the software implementations of cryptographic algorithms,
%  and are practical to be exploited~\cite{Ac2007Cache,atici2016remote,Bernstein2005Cache,saraswat2014remote}.
Compared with other side channels
 on electromagnetic fields, power,
 ground electric potential and acoustic emanations,
 cache-based timing side-channel attacks do not require special equipments
    or extra physical access to the victim computer system.
 Moreover,
  such remote attacks only require the least privilege to (remotely) invoke the necessary encryption/decryption functions,
while other active cache-based side-channel attacks involve operations
 by a task sharing caches with the victim cryptographic engine
%   such as cross-VM side-channel attack, FLUSH+RELOAD, and access-driven cache-attacks
\cite{YinqianZhang2012-cross-vm,get-off-my-cloud,flushreload,Gullasch2011Cache}.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

%Since little acquirements are needed, this type attack is easy to deploy and hard to defense.
Different methods are proposed against the remote cache side channels.
 {\scshape{Warm}} and  {\scshape{Delay}} are two typical algorithm-independent mechanisms.

 The key point is to break the relationship between secret keys and the execution time by eliminating the cache misses or confusing the cache misses.
Although the existing methods can offer some security guarantee, most of them have some drawbacks. Some methods which are implemented on hardware to control the cache lack universality. Some using particular implementation to make algorithms constant time are just suitable to specific algorithms.
Some introducing many extra operations to eliminate or confuse the cache misses incur significant performance overheads. It is difficult to perform a universal and high efficient method to defend against the remote cache timing attacks.
Two elementary operations,
  \emph{warm} (i.e., to fill cache lines by reading constant tables)
  and \emph{delay} (i.e., to insert padding instructions after the encryption/decryption operations),
  have been proposed to prevent cache side-channel attacks \cite{Osvik2006Cache,Gullasch2011Cache,Bernstein2005Cache,Canteaut2006Understanding}. %Gullasch2011Cache 是说：1.将进程和data绑定，从而保证cache hit；2.将查找表uncacheable，每次cache miss

However, performance.
\textbf{[their shortcoming here]}

In this paper, we integrate {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}} into an algorithm-independent mechanism
   to eliminate remote cache timing side channels.
Different from existing schemes,
   the proposed {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme achieves the optimal performance (that is, no unnecessary operations)
    while ensure that not information is leaked through timing.
The optimal performance is analyzed theoretically and validated experimentally.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Destroy the relationship between the execution time and cache misses/hits,
  to ensure security.
That is, the measured execution time reflects either the best case (i.e., all lookup tables are cached),
     or the worst case (i.e., none of tables is in caches).
\item
Prefer warm for the best case, to optimize the performance.
Warm before executing the encryption/decryption operations,
  if not all tables are cached.
However, cached data may be evicted by system activities and
    the effect of warm is destroyed;
  in this case,
    the time of encryption/decryption may reflect the data cache access,
   and then delay operation makes the execution to be the worst case.
\item
% 将warm放到delay的时间中
If delay is performed,
  warm is also done for the next encryption/decryption operation to raise the performance.
So, some useless padding instructions are utilized to perform warm instead.
Note that warm also consumes CPU cycles.
\end{enumerate}


%1. the时间与data无关，或者是全部都在cache的时间，或者是全部都不在cache的时间；使得无法推导data相关
%2. 优先使用warm；使得能够提高效率；注意：warm也是需要占用时间的。warm没有效果时，用delay。
%3. 条件的判断，基于时间，不需要特殊的操作和权限；

The proposed {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme does not require any privileged operation on the system.
The conditions to perform warm and delay, are defined as regular timing.
Reading constant tables, padding instructions, and timing are commonly supported in computer systems,
   no privileged operations.
The scheme is independent of algorithms and implementations.
   It does not depend on any special design or feature of block ciphers,
and it is applicable to different implementations.
%  except that the lookup tables are accessible in the warm operations.

We apply this scheme to AES, and analyze the situations that it produces the optimal performance.
It is found that, in commodity computer systems,
 it achieves the optimal performance of AES with different key sizes (128, 192, 256 bits)
    and different implementations (2KB, 4KB, 4.25KB, and 5KB lookup tables).
In particular, it achieves the optimized performance for the AES-128 implementation with 2KB lookup tables \cite{Daemen2002The},
when (\emph{a}) the probability
 that some entries of lookup tables are evict from caches by system activities during the executions of encryption/decryption, denoted as $P_{evict}$, is less than $0.2$, and
 (\emph{b}) the ratio of
  the delayed time  to the time of reading constant tables from  either caches or RAM,
  denoted as $k$, is less than $57.4$.
These conditions hold for continuous AES executions in commodity systems,
  and confirmed experimentally by the prototype.
In fact, our scheme produces the optimized performance for  various AES implementations (the lookup tables in size of 2K, 4KB, 4.25KB and 5KB) in different key length (128, 192 and 256 bits), when $P_{evict} < 0.2$ and $k < 42.41$.
These conditions also hold in commodity systems.


   % 各种输入是攻击情况，仍然是相同的分布。这一块的实验，我们没有做。是否需要做？
   % 对于original，在图上，哪些是可以利用来攻击的，应该有所标注【或者使用文字】。
We implement the {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme with AES.
Experiment results on Linux with one Intel Core i7-2600 CPU and 2GB RAM,
  demonstrate that, the measured time does  not reflect the data cache access.
We also validate the optimization in different scenarios,
 by comparing it with different strategies of warm and delay.

To the best of our knowledge,
  this work is the first protection against cache timing side channels with optimal performance.
The optimal performance is analyzed  theoretically and validated by experiments.
Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
We present {\scshape{Warm+Delay}},
   a defense mechanism efficiently combining warm and delay operations to eliminate remote cache timing side channels.
The scheme is algorithm-independent and need no special privilege, so it can be widely used in all block ciphers with lookup tables.
\item
We theoretically analyze the defense scheme and find the optimal way to use the warm and delay operation with security.
We apply the scheme into AES and verify the security and performance both in theory and experiments.
\end{itemize}
