In  practical implementations of a cryptographic algorithm,
   the cryptographic keys could be leaked through  side channels on
    timing \cite{Acii2005Improving,Ac2006Trace,Bonneau2006Cache,Bernstein2005Cache,Gullasch2011Cache,Kocher1996Timing,Neve2006A,Osvik2006Cache,Tsunoo2003Cryptanalysis,Tromer2010Efficient}, % 引用一些在不同的方法上，有开创性的
    electromagnetic fields \cite{Electromagnetic-sidechannel}, power \cite{power-pc,Bertoni2005AES},
 ground electric potential \cite{electric-potential-sidechannel} or acoustic emanations \cite{Acoustic-sidechannel},
  even when the algorithm is semantically secure.
%  Side channel attacks are using these vulnerabilities to obtain the sensitive information.
  Among these vulnerabilities,
   timing side-channel attacks are easily launched without special probe devices.
In particular, remote timing side channels allow an attacker without
    any system or physical privilege on the computer,
    to disclose the keys
   only by repeatedly invoking the encryption/decryption functions and measuring the execution time \cite{Tsunoo2002Cryptanalysis,Bernstein2005Cache,Bonneau2006Cache,Neve2006A,Brumley2011Remote,Brumley2005Remote}.
% 公钥算法的timing，也很明显，但是与cache无关？引用remote cache攻击
%Public key algorithms have proved the most vulnerable to timing attacks because they typically perform lengthy mathematical operations, the running time of which depends directly on the data due to branch statements
%Timing side channel attacks are the easiest to be carried out because the time is measured simply and they don't require specialized equipment.
%在AES选举的过程中，认为AES是基于查找表的实现，其是能够抵抗像RSA、ECC这些分支跳转产生的执行时间差异所引入的side channel attack

Remote timing side channels passively exploiting the time difference of data cache misses and hits,
    called \emph{remote cache timing side channels} in this paper,
 are widely found in various implementations of block ciphers \cite{Ac2007Cache,Bernstein2005Cache,Bonneau2006Cache,Tsunoo2002Cryptanalysis,Tsunoo2003Cryptanalysis,atici2016remote,saraswat2014remote}. % Brumley2011Remote,Brumley2005Remote, 分别是针对ECC 和RSA 的，而且不是针对cache hit or miss的。 广泛存在\cite{}
In these implementations,
  table lookup is the primary time-consuming operation in encryption and decryption.
Because accessing data in caches is much faster than those in RAM chips,
 cache misses and hits in table lookup
    remarkably influence the overall execution time of block ciphers.
Therefore,
   from the execution time, the attackers are able to infer the inputs of table lookup operations that are determined by the secret keys (and also the known plaintext/ciphertext).
Generally, for a block cipher,
  encryption and decryption are symmetric computations with similar basic operations.
  In the remainder, we emphasize encryption only, but the designs and conclusions are applicable to decryption.
%Different inputs of table lookup cause different cache access behavior so that the overall time differs, which are related to the secret keys,    and then the information about keys leaks.

%	Cache timing side channel是指利用密码计算过程中，对于cache/RAM访问而导致的timing特征，获得密钥。在大量的对称密码算法中，有“与key相关的查表操作”，与cache相关；影响到timing。攻击者就可以从timing获得推导密钥信息。
%	Remote side channel是指，攻击者可以远程发起，不需要接触或者近距离在密码系统旁边，也不需要在密码计算机器上有什么操作权限。相比其他的side channel，remote cache timing side channel的攻击条件很低，影响更多。最早是有……攻击[??]，后来又有什么发展。

%Remote timing cache side channels widely exists in the software implementations of cryptographic algorithms,
%  and are practical to be exploited~\cite{Ac2007Cache,atici2016remote,Bernstein2005Cache,saraswat2014remote}.
Compared with other side channels
 on power, electromagnetic fields,
 ground electric potential and acoustic emanations,
 cache-based timing side-channel attacks do not require special equipments
    or extra physical access to the victim computer system.
 Moreover,
  such remote attacks only require the least privilege to (remotely) invoke the necessary encryption/decryption functions,
while other active cache-based side-channel attacks involve operations
 by a task sharing caches with the victim cryptographic engine
%   such as cross-VM side-channel attack, FLUSH+RELOAD, and access-driven cache-attacks
\cite{YinqianZhang2012-cross-vm,get-off-my-cloud,flushreload,Gullasch2011Cache}.

%Since little acquirements are needed, this type attack is easy to deploy and hard to defense.
Different methods are proposed against cache timing side-channel attacks,
  by destroying the relationship between the secret keys and the execution time.
Intuitively,
  the basic design is
    to perform encryption, \emph{a})  with all lookup tables inside/outside caches,
    or \emph{b}) in a constant period of time.
%Although the existing methods can offer some security guarantee, most of them have some drawbacks.
%It is difficult to perform a universal and high efficient method to defend against the remote cache timing attacks.
In particular,
 {\scshape{Warm}} and  {\scshape{Delay}} are two typical algorithm-independent and implementation-transparent mechanisms
    to eliminate cache timing side channels \cite{Osvik2006Cache,Gullasch2011Cache,Bernstein2005Cache,Canteaut2006Understanding,Zhang2011Predictive}.
    {\scshape{Warm}} fills cache lines by reading constant lookup tables \emph{before} the encryption operations,
    and
    {\scshape{Delay}} inserts padding instructions \emph{after} the encryption operations;\footnote{To perform encryption
     always without caches is another choice, but it is inefficient.
     Moreover, a typical strategy of {\scshape{Delay}}
     is to finish the encryption operation in constant time that is equal to the execution time without any caches.}
  so the execution time measured by the attackers does not reflect the cache misses/hits \emph{during} encryption.

These two common mechanisms prevent cache-based timing attacks at different phases,
    but introduce extra operations and degrade the performance greatly.
In this paper, we investigate the performance of cryptographic functions protected by {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}},
  and attempt to find the best strategy to integrate these countermeasures.
%    with the optimal performance while effectively eliminate remote cache side channels.
%As there are different strategies to apply {\scshape{Warm}} and  {\scshape{Delay}} in the implementations of block ciphers,
%% %Gullasch2011Cache 是说：1.将进程和data绑定，从而保证cache hit；2.将查找表uncacheable，每次cache miss
%Intro：
%	各种Side channel威胁到密码系统的安全性，包括timing、电磁、xxxx、xxx。利用Side channel攻击者能够获得密钥。Timing side channel是其中容易发起的一种，因为只需要计时、不需要专门的设备。
%	Cache timing side channel是指利用密码计算过程中，对于cache/RAM访问而导致的timing特征，获得密钥。在大量的对称密码算法中，有“与key相关的查表操作”，与cache相关；影响到timing。攻击者就可以从timing获得推导密钥信息。
%	Remote side channel是指，攻击者可以远程发起，不需要接触或者近距离在密码系统旁边，也不需要在密码计算机器上有什么操作权限。相比其他的side channel，remote cache timing side channel的攻击条件很低，影响更多。最早是有……攻击[??]，后来又有什么发展。
%    we attempt to integrate them into a scheme
%   achieving the optimal performance while effectively eliminating remote cache timing side channels.
In particular,
    the following principles are analyzed in the integration:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Each encryption is protected by {\scshape{Warm}} or {\scshape{Delay}},
   i.e., it is performed with all lookup tables in caches
   or it is finished after a constant period of time.
%Destroy the relationship between the execution time and cache misses/hits,   to ensure security.
The measured time reflects either the best case (i.e., all lookup tables are cached by {\scshape{Warm}}),
     or the worst case (i.e., it is delayed to the execution time without any caches).

\item
In order to optimize the performance,
  {\scshape{Warm}} is preferred to {\scshape{Delay}};
  i.e.,
    finish  encryption operations as many as possible, with all lookup tables in caches.
Note that,
    compared with the best case protected by {\scshape{Warm}},
  the worst case by {\scshape{Delay}} costs about eight times of CPU cycles.
Only when the effect of {\scshape{Warm}} is broken  by system activities, such as interrupts and task scheduling,
    and then information on the secret key may be leaked,
  the execution time is delayed in the worst case.

\item
% 将warm放到delay的时间中
When {\scshape{Delay}} is performed,
  {\scshape{Warm}} is  done as a part of inserted instructions
   for the next encryption.
So, the cost of {\scshape{Warm}} is masked by padding instructions,  % are utilized to perform warm instead.
%Note that warm also consumes CPU cycles.
and the performance is further improved.
\end{enumerate}


%1. the时间与data无关，或者是全部都在cache的时间，或者是全部都不在cache的时间；使得无法推导data相关
%2. 优先使用warm；使得能够提高效率；注意：warm也是需要占用时间的。warm没有效果时，用delay。
%3. 条件的判断，基于时间，不需要特殊的操作和权限；

We apply the optimization  integration scheme to AES,
    and analyze the situations that it produces the optimal performance.
It is proven that,
   the integration scheme with appropriate parameters,
   achieves \emph{the optimal performance with the least extra operations};
    that is, without unnecessary lookup table read operations
   or inserted padding instructions.
%In particular, we apply this scheme to AES, 
%It is found that, 
The optimal performance of the integrated {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme with different key sizes (128, 192, and 256 bits)
    and different implementations (2KB, 4KB, 4.25KB, and 5KB lookup tables),
    is investigated in commodity computer systems.
For example,
    the protected AES-128 implementation with 2KB lookup tables \cite{Daemen2002The} achieves the optimal performance,
when (\emph{a}) the probability
 that some entries of lookup tables are evicted from caches
  due to system activities during encryption, denoted as $P_{evict}$, {\color{red}is less than $0.2$}, and
 (\emph{b}) the ratio of
  the delayed time of padding instructions to the time of reading constant tables from  either caches or RAM,
  denoted as $k$, {\color{red}is less than $57.4$}.
These conditions hold %for continuous AES executions
 in commodity computer systems,
  which is confirmed by our experiments.
The conditions for other AES implementations of different key sizes,
            {\color{red} $P_{evict} < 0.2$ and $k < 42.41$}, also hold in commodity systems.
%In fact, our protection scheme produces the optimal performance for various AES implementations (the lookup tables in size of 2KB, 4KB, 4.25KB and 5KB) of different key sizes (128, 192 and 256 bits), 



   % 各种输入是攻击情况，仍然是相同的分布。这一块的实验，我们没有做。是否需要做？
   % 对于original，在图上，哪些是可以利用来攻击的，应该有所标注【或者使用文字】。
We analyze the performance, assuming that the integrated scheme does not require any privileged operation on the computer system.
The conditions to perform {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}}, are defined as regular timing.
Reading constant tables, inserting padding instructions, and timing are commonly supported in computer systems
    without special privileges.
The scheme is independent of algorithms and implementations.
   It does not depend on any special design or feature of block ciphers,
and it is applicable to different implementations.
%  except that the lookup tables are accessible in the warm operations.



To the best of our knowledge,
  this work is the first to systematically analyze the optimal performance of
    integrating {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}} against cache timing side channels  in commodity computer systems.
Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
We investigate the performance overheads of {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}},
    and derive the scheme to integrate these countermeasures
        with the optimal performance while effectively eliminate remote cache side channels.
Two basic countermeasures are algorithm-independent and implementation-transparent,
   and the integration does not require any privileged operation on the computer system.
We apply the integration scheme to AES,
   and analyze the situations that it produces the optimal performance.

\item
We implement the integrated {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme on Linux with Intel Core CPUs for AES-128,
  and confirm experimentally that it (\emph{a}) eliminates cache timing side channels,
   (\emph{b}) outperforms other different integration strategies of {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}}, and
   (\emph{c}) works without any privileged operations on the system.
