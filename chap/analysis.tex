%In this section, we first introduce five principles that lead to an optimized {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} performance. We then examine these principles with our proposed algorithm, and derive practical conditions which make the proposed algorithm optimal. We first examine the performance of \vdelay, and then analyze the \vwam~operation with AES as the cryptographic algorithm, and show that our scheme is optimal. Last, we discuss the impact of different key lengths and different algorithm implementations.
%All the detailed conditions are practical.


In this section, we prove that the {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme achieves the optimal performance with the least extra operations,
 by applying it to AES and analyzing  the situations that it produces the optimal performance.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:eval}

In the scheme,
        the extra operations are introduced by {\scshape{Warm}}, {\scshape{Delay}} and {\scshape{GetTime}}.
   The cost of {\scshape{GetTime}} is fixed and necessary,
 so the overheads are determined by the cost of each {\scshape{Warm}} (or {\scshape{Delay}}) operation,
    and the times of these operations.
% so the main point is to optimize the use of {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}}.
%In the literature, the fundamental rule in defending against timing side channel attacks is to eliminate any observable pattern between the encryption times and the inputs (plaintexts), i.e. to make them fully independent. Three categories of solutions have been proposed~\cite{Braun2015Robust}: (1) application-specific changes, (2) static transformation, and (3) dynamic padding. The first two both require platform-specific modifications to the implementation of the encryption algorithms. We adopt the third approach in our solution (\vdelay), and further introduce {\vwarm}  (i.e., cache warm) to improve performance.
Therefore, the following principles need to be satisfied to achieve the optimal performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In the {\vdelay} operation, the imposed delay, or the execution time of padding instructions, is the shortest.
    \item The number of {\vdelay} operations is minimum.
    \item In the {\vwarm} operation, only the minimum necessary data are loaded into caches. % as little as possible.
    \item The number of  {\vwarm} operations is minimum.
    \item Because {\vwarm} is much more efficient than {\vdelay},{\footnote{It is true for any computing platform in practice; otherwise, caches are useless in performance improvement.}} {\vwarm} is preferred over {\vdelay}. % than \verb+delay+.
\end{itemize}

Next, we examine these principles with the {\vwd} scheme, and derive the practical conditions which make it optimal.
We first examine the performance of \vdelay, and then analyze the {\vwarm} operation for AES-128 with 2KB lookup tables \cite{openssl}.
In the proof, we show that it is statistically the most efficient to load all lookup tables in \vwarm, instead of loading parts of the tables (which probably leads to more {\vdelay} in the future).
Then we identify the best condition for the {\vwarm} operation,
  and eventually derive the practical condition so that the {\vwd} scheme (with appropriate parameters) is optimal.
%That is, performing {\vwarm} when the execution time of encryption lies in $(T_{NM}, \infty)$ is the optimal in commodity systems.

Last, we extend the conclusions to different key lengths of AES and different implementations,
  and show that, the conditions are applicable to these typical key lengths and implementations.
That is, the derived {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme achieves the optimal performance for various AES implementations with lookup tables.

%In our {\vwd}  scheme, we perform delay operation when the execution time is in $(T_{NM}, T_{W})$, and delay it to $T_{W}$. The {\vwarm}  (cache warm) operation in our scheme loads all the lookup tables into the cache. Hence, the overhead depends on the size of the lookup tables and the implementation of algorithms. We implement our scheme in AES-128 with 4.25KB lookup tables in the proof in Section 4.3. In the proof, we show that it is statistically the most efficient to load all lookup tables in \vwarm, instead of loading parts of the tables (which leads to more {\vwarm}  in the future). Then we identify the best timing for the {\vwarm}  operation. In particular, we will discuss three cache-access states: (1) all the lookup tables are in the cache ($S_{full}$); (2) the lookup entries not in the cache are not accessed ($S_{nonas}$); (3) and the entries not in the cache are accessed ($S_{as}$). We will compare the additional time introduced by our scheme vs. other methods. Eventually, we derive a practical condition, so that our scheme is optimal when the condition is satisfied. That is, performing warmup operation when the execution time lies in $(T_{NM}, \infty)$ is the optimal method in our experiment environment.

%The sketch is needed here!+++++++++++

%Next we discuss \verb+delay+ and \verb+warmup+ in details. we discuss the \verb+warmup+ operation after the \verb+delay+ operation because the \verb+warmup+ has some relation to the \verb+delay+.

\subsection{Performance Analysis of \vdelay}
%\vspace{-2mm}
%The analysis of {\vdelay}  is independent of the encryption algorithm used in the scheme.
\begin{theorem}
\label{delay2tw} In the {\vdelay} operation, delay to $T_{W}$ imposes the minimal overhead
   while effectively eliminates the cache timing side channels.
\end{theorem}

\begin{IEEEproof}
From the attackers' point of view,
   there are three types of measured time that are unexploitable
    (i.e. the execution time does not reflect the cache misses/hits of \emph{specific} lookup table entries):
    $T_{NM}$, $T_{W}$, and any value greater than $T_{W}$.
$T_{NM}$  means that \emph{all} accessed lookup entries are in caches before encryption,
 and
$T_{W}$ corresponds to the longest execution path, when all lookup tables are not cached before encryption (and they are loaded into caches as the encryption operation is performed);
 so such results are the same for any input.
When the measured time is longer than $T_{W}$,
  encryption is disturbed by unknown system activities (e.g. interrupts and task scheduling),
   and it is impossible for the attackers to exclude the disturbance and find the exact execution time of encryption.

If we delay the execution time to any value less than $T_{W}$,
 a little information about the cache access leaks.
Or, if we delay it to a random value, which may be greater or less than $T_{W}$,
    the attackers could exclude all results greater than $T_{W}$
      and the other results are still exploitable.
Such methods reduce the attack accuracy on each invocation,
  but does not eliminate the cache timing side channels completely.
Therefore, delay to $T_{W}$ imposes the minimal overhead
   while effectively eliminates the cache timing side channels.
%\qed
\end{IEEEproof}


\begin{theorem}
\label{delaynum}
 Performing the {\vdelay} operation when the execution time of encryption
 is in $(T_{NM}, T_{W})$ results in the smallest number of {\vdelay} operations. % when we cannot distinguish the reason why encryption takes longer than $T_{NM}$ (cache miss or the OS scheduler and  interrupt handler).
\end{theorem} % 这里when后的部分需要吗
%******BL: 我也觉得后面半句可以不要，因为下文有解释。我先把这半句注释掉了


\begin{IEEEproof}
As described above,
 if the execution time of encryption is equal to or less than $T_{NM}$, no cache miss occurs,
  and
if the execution time is equal to $T_W$ or greater, it is unexploitable.
The execution time is independent of keys and plaintexts/ciphertexts in these cases,
  so {\vdelay} is unnecessary.


%If the encryption time is greater than $T_{W}$,
% it means that the OS scheduler or interruption handler has been invoked during encryption -- the attacker could not recover the actual encryption time to perform timing attacks, because the time for OS scheduler or interruption handler is unpredictable.

When the execution time is in $(T_{NM}, T_{W})$,
 it may be due to cache misses, and/or system activities (but the overhead is less than $T_{W} - T_{NM}$).
We cannot distinguish the exact reasons without special privileges.
However, the attackers can distinguish them by repeatedly invoking the cryptographic function using the same input (and secret key).
 Therefore, {\vdelay} is  necessary in this case.
%\qed
\end{IEEEproof}

In our {\vwd}  scheme, the {\vdelay} operation satisfies the Theorem~\ref{delay2tw} and \ref{delaynum}.
 So the use of {\vdelay} can achieve the optimal performance in the {\vwd}  scheme.


\subsection{Performance Analysis of \vwarm}
%\vspace{-1mm}

We apply the {\vwd}  scheme to AES-128 with a 2KB lookup table \cite{openssl},
  as described in Section \ref{back:aes}.
%The {\vwarm}  operation is applied to the lookup tables, which consume 2KB in total.
We show that, in this case, the {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme produces the best performance in commodity computer systems,
that is, introduces the least extra {\vwarm} and {\vdelay} operations.
The details about other key sizes (192 and 256 bits) and different implementations (4KB, 4.25KB, and 5KB lookup tables),
  are included in Section \ref{analy:otherkey}.
%In Section \ref{analy:otherkey}, we also discuss other key lengths and other implementations and other algorithms.

\subsubsection{the content of {\vwarm}}
{\vwarm} operation needs to load the lookup table into the caches.
 It takes less time that loading parts of the table.
  But it also may introduce extra {\vdelay} operation if the unloaded parts are accessed.
  
We denote the size of a cache line as $C$,
    and the time cost to load a cache line of data from RAM to L1D cache as $T_{cl}$.
  For an AES implementation of $R$ rounds with an $L$-byte lookup table ($L \gg C$), we have the following theorem.

%The average time saved by not loading one cache line from RAM is denoted as $t_{nc}$,


%\begin{theorem}\label{theorm:warmall} For the hardware of commodity computers, loading all the AES lookup tables into the cache is the best warm operation.\end {theorem}
\begin{theorem}\label{theorm:warmall}
If $B_{nl}(N) < D_{nl}(N)$ for any $0 < N \leq \frac{L}{C}$,
%\Delta T_{warm} < E(T_{delay})$ ,
 loading all entries of the lookup table into caches in the {\vwarm} operation provides better performance
 than loading any part of entries,
where $B_{nl}(N) = N T_{cl}$ and $D_{nl}(N) = (1- (1-\frac{NC}{L})^{16 R})(T_{W}-T_{NM})$.
\end{theorem}
%\begin{theorem}\label{theorm:warmall}
%If $T_{cl} < (1- (1-\frac{NC}{L})^{16 R})(T_{W}-T_{NM})/N$ for any $0 < N \leq \frac{L}{C}$,
% then loading all entries of the lookup table into caches in the {\vwarm} operation provides better performance
% than any part of entries.
%%where $B_{nl}(N) = N T_{cl}$ and $D_{nl}(N) = (1- (1-\frac{NC}{L})^{16 R})(T_{W}-T_{NM})$.
%\end{theorem}

\begin{IEEEproof}
It takes $T_{cl} > 0$ to load data into a cache line in the {\vwarm} operation;
 %on the other hand,
 while,
 if some entry is uncached,
  the execution time of AES encryption may become longer and then it triggers an extra {\vdelay} operation.
Not loading $N$ ($\frac{L}{C} \geq N > 0$) cache lines of table entries saves the execution time of \vwarm,
 while the potential cost is
    the longer execution of encryption  and the extra execution of \vdelay.

Since $L \gg C$, we needs $\frac{L}{C}$ cache lines to hold the lookup table.
In each round of AES encryption,
 the lookup table is accessed for $16$ times.
We assume that, in each round, the input of \texttt{SubBytes} is random and then
    each table entry is accessed  uniformly.
Hence,
 the probability that $N$ certain cache lines are not accessed after $R$ rounds of AES encryption, denoted as $P_{\bar{a}ccess}(N)$,
  is $P_{\bar{a}ccess}(N) = (1-\frac{NC}{L})^{16 R}$.



%In AES, {\vwarm}  loads all lookup tables into cache. In the case that at least one corresponding cache line is \emph{not} loaded,
% cache miss may happen, which will in turn trigger {\vdelay}  operation. Therefore,

%For {\vwarm} operation, if there exists $N>0$ making the time saved by not warming $N$ cache lines larger than the expected overhead of invoking {\vdelay}, not warming $N$ cache lines provides better performance. Otherwise, loading all lookup tables into the cache is the best.


%For AES with 2KB lookup table implementation, it just use one lookup table $L_{2k}$ with 2KB.
%For a cache line utilized by AES look up tables, the probability that it loads $T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}$ is $16/17$, while the probability it loads the content of $T_{4}$ is $1/17$.

%Therefore, the probability that a certain cache line of $L_{2k}$ is not accessed in all rounds is $P_{1} = (1-\frac{C}{L})^{160}$.
%The expected probability that any cache line is not accessed in one AES execution is $P_{e} = \frac{16}{17}P_{0-3}+ \frac{1}{17}P_{4}$.
If a table entry is uncached but accessed during the execution of AES encryption,
   the execution time is greater than $T_{NM}$ and {\vdelay} is performed.
Therefore, if $N$ cache lines of table entries are not in caches,
    the probability of extra {\vdelay} is listed as follows.
  \begin{equation}
  \label{equ:delay}
 {P}_{delay} = 1-P_{\bar{a}ccess}(N) = 1- (1-\frac{NC}{L})^{16 R}
\end{equation}


The execution time shall be delayed to $T_W$ according to Theorem \ref{delay2tw},
 while it is $T_{NM}$ if all entries are in caches.
So the expected overhead (or the time cost) due to not loading $N$ cache lines of table entries is:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \label{equ:tdelay}
&D_{nl}(N)&={ }  {P}_{delay}  (T_{W}-T_{NM})  \nonumber \\
&&= (1- (1-\frac{NC}{L})^{16 R})(T_{W}-T_{NM}).
\end{eqnarray}

On the other hand,
the benefit  of not loading data into $N$ cache lines in the {\vwarm} operation is
\begin{eqnarray}
B_{nl}(N) = N T_{cl}.
\end{eqnarray}

Finally,
(1)
If $B_{nl}(N) < D_{nl}(N)$ for any $\frac{L}{C} \geq N > 0$,
 loading all entries of the lookup table into caches in the {\vwarm} operation provides the optimal performance;
% (1) If $\forall N>0, \Delta T_{warm} < E(T_{delay})$, warming all cache lines is always better.
and (2) if there exists $N$ satisfying that $B_{nl}(N) > D_{nl}(N)$, not loading $N$ cache lines of table entries provides better performance.
%  and (3) If $\exists N>0, \Delta T_{warm} = E(T_{delay})$, warming or not warming $N$ cache lines provides equivalent performance.
%\qed
\end{IEEEproof}


%In the {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme, {\vwarm} is performed  after encryption
%    as a part of the {\vdelay} operation, as shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:aesdefense}.
%So the \emph{actual} cost of loading data into $N$ cache lines (or
%   the benefit of not loading these data) in {\vwarm} is less than $B_{nl}(N)$.
%For example,
%    when the time of {\scshape{Crypt}} plus {\vwarm} is less than  $T_W$ (Line 8 in Algorithm \ref{alg:aesdefense}),
%  the  cost of {\vwarm} is actually zero.
%
%Therefore,
%  the average cost of loading data into $N$ cache lines in the {\vwarm} operation is \emph{actually} less than $N T_{cl}$,
%      so loading all entries in {\vwarm} still provides better performance
% than any part of entries if $B_{nl}(N) = N T_{cl} < D_{nl}(N)$ for any $\frac{L}{C} \geq N > 0$.


% Therefore, the time of {\vwarm}  becomes part of delay.
% When this case occurs, the extra time reduced by warming some cache line is zero,
% if the AES execution time plus {\vwarm}  time is less than $T_{W}$.


% 这一段我是想说，咱们的方案中，warm 是在AES 计算之后进行的，当AES计算如果大于WET的时候，warm之后不进行delay，所以warm少几个cache line节省的开销是按照上面的计算，说明warm 比不warm 要优。而在AES计算小于WET 时，warm操作本身就是delay的一部分，那么可以认为warm的操作开销减小，这时warm 自然是全部warm 最优。

\begin{corollary}

For the AES-128 implementation with a 2KB lookup table
in commodity computer systems,
loading all entries of the lookup table into caches in the {\vwarm} operation
   provides better performance than any part of entries.
\end{corollary}

\begin{IEEEproof}
Firstly,
 with commodity hardware, the cache is enough to load all entries of the lookup tables.
For example, AES is implemented with the lookup tables of 2KB, 4KB, 4.25KB or 5KB,
   and the lookup table of DES/3DES is 2KB.
However, the typical L1D cache is 32KB or 64KB for Intel CPUs, and 16KB or 32KB for ARM CPUs.


In our experiments on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M8400t PC with an Intel Core i7-2600 CPU and 2GB RAM,
$T_{W}$, $T_{NM}$, and $T_{cl}$ are $2834, 355, 55.68$ in CPU cycles, respectively
 (see Section \ref{sec:implementation} for details).
%%% 计数的数字保留，最好一致。例如，都是小数点后1位、2位，固定一致。
Table~\ref{tbl:warmcontent} shows $B_{nl}(N)$ and $D_{nl}(N)$,
    when $R = 10$, $L = 2KB$, and $C = 64B$.
We find that, the cost of not loading $N$ ($32 \geq N >0$) cache lines of lookup table is always much greater than the benefit.
The result is applicable to other commodity computer systems.
So by Theorem \ref{theorm:warmall}, loading all entries in {\vwarm} produces the optimal performance.
\end{IEEEproof}

In our {\vwd} scheme, {\vwarm} is performed  after encryption
   as a part of the {\vdelay} operation, as shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:aesdefense}.
So the cost of {\vwarm} is reduced significantly, further making that loading all entries of the lookup table in {\vwarm} is better.

 %The time $T_{W}$ is 2834 CPU cycles, while the shortest AES execution time $T_{NM}$ is 309 cycles. The average time $T_{cl}$ for loading one cache line of lookup table is 55.68 cycles.

%************************************分隔符******************************************
%\begin{theorem}\label{lemma:warmaftermiss}
%For commodity computers, performing  {\vwarm}  when cache-miss occurred during the previous execution results the minimum extra time.
%\end{theorem}
\subsubsection{state transition of continuous invocations of AES}
We consider the different states of the lookup table in the L1 cache during the continuous invocations of AES encryption.
The state of the lookup table is estimated after each execution of AES encryption.
  There are three states:
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item
     $S_{c}$: all entries of the lookup tables are in caches,
   \item
     $S_{\bar{c}, a}$: some entries are uncached, and at least one of them is accessed during the AES encryption,
   \item
     $S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}$: some entries are uncached, but none of them is accessed during the AES encryption.
  \end{enumerate}
$S_{\bar{c}, a}$ and $S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}$ represent the states where one or more cache lines of table entries are uncached or evicted from caches.


The transition among the three states can be triggered by three events:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{Warm} event: performing {\vwarm} to load all the lookup tables into the cache which probability is denoted as $P_{warm}$.
  \item
    \emph{Evict} event: the entries of lookup tables may be evicted from the cache if task scheduling, interrupts or any other system activities occur during the execution of encryptions. The probability that eviction occurs is denoted as $P_{evict}$.
  \item
    \emph{Execution} event: For one AES encryption, some entries are uncached before encryption and it is possible that some of them is accessed during the encryption, and this probability is denoted as $P_{access}$. Actually, $P_{access}$ equals $P_{delay}$ in Theorem~\ref{theorm:warmall}.
\end{enumerate}

% 哪些事件导致状态转移？概率表示为。
% 事件的定义
%warm:
%evict:
%access: P   $\bar{P}$

%$P_{nona}$ (equals to $P_{N}$) is the probability that the entries not in the cache are not needed in one execution; while $P_{evict}$ is the probability that some entries are evicted from the cache.


%在状态转移过程中，cache状态发生转移，则需执行一次AES。
%上述三种事件的发生，会使得状态发生改变。
%假设三种事件在状态转移过程中只发生一次。
%AES执行肯定是最后发生，因为执行结束，cache状态以发生转移。
%先warm后evict

The occurrence of these three events will change the state of lookup tables in the cache.
 %During the state transition, the state of lookup tables changes which means one AES executes.
  We assume that during one state transition, each of the three events occurs once at most.
   Because the state changes after the \emph{Execution} event, the \emph{Execution} event occurs the last.
    Besides we assume that the \emph{Warm} event occurs after the \emph{Evict} event.
     It is reasonable because if the Warm event occurs, the Evict event before it has no effect on the state of lookup tables.
In the following, we temporarily do not consider the effect of the partial warm caused by the \emph{Execution} event.

In {\vwd} scheme, the warm strategy that performing {\vwarm} when some cache misses occur during the pervious execution of encryption is denoted as conditional {\vwarm}.
While considering other two cases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    less {\vwarm}: performing {\vwarm} with a probability $P_{warm}^{\ominus}\in[0,1)$  when cache misses occur during the pervious execution of encryption;
  \item
    more {\vwarm}: performing {\vwarm} when some cache misses occur during the pervious execution of encryption and also performing {\vwarm} with a probability $P_{warm}^{\oplus}\in[0,1]$ in other conditions.
\end{itemize}

The Markov Chain can be used to simulate the state transitions.
 The state of the lookup table in the caches denoted as $X_{n}$ takes values in the state space $\{S_{c},S_{\bar{c}, a},S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}\}$.
  %The transition probabilities denoted as $P_{j|i}$, where $i$ and $j$ are in the state space, represents that
   if the lookup table in the caches is in the state $i$, the probability that it will be in the state $j$ after one step is given by $P_{j|i}$, where $i$ and $j$ are in the state space.
    That is
    $$
    P\{X_{n+1}=j|X_n=i\}=P_{j|i}\ \ , \ \ \  i,j \in \{S_{c},S_{\bar{c}, a},S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}\} .
    $$
Then we analyze the stationary distributions for the three different strategies.

\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Conditional {\vwarm}}
 The state transition diagram of conditional {\vwarm} is shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:conditioncase}.
$P_{access|S_{c}}$ and $P_{access|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}$ represent the probability that some entries of lookup tables which are uncached before encryption are accessed during the encryption.
 Due to the difference of the quantity of entries of lookup tables not in the cache, $P_{access|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}$ is no less than $P_{access|S_{c}}$.
 %We use $P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}$ to represent $P_{evict}^{\mathfrak{2}}P_{a}^{\mathfrak{21}}+(1-P_{evict}^{\mathfrak{2}})P_{a}^{\mathfrak{22}}$.
%Because we can not determine how many lookup entries are evicted, the ranges of $P_{a}^{\mathfrak{1}}$, $P_{a}^{\mathfrak{21}}$ and $P_{a}^{\mathfrak{22}}$ are the same.
%So  $P_{a}^{\mathfrak{2}}$ has the same range with $P_{a}^{\mathfrak{1}}$.

We use $\Pi_{c}$, $\Pi_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}$, $\Pi_{\bar{c}, a}$ to represent
the stationary distribution of the three states and the values are as follows.

\begin{equation}

%\setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}

\paragraph{Less {\vwarm}}
The state transition diagram of less {\vwarm} is shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:lesscase}.
$P_{access|S_{c}}$ and $P_{access|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}^{\ominus}$ represent the probability that some entries of lookup tables which are uncached before encryption are accessed during the encryption.
As the same in conditional {\vwarm}, $P_{access|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}^{\ominus}$ is no less than $P_{access|S_{c}}$.
%Also the ranges of $P_{a}^{\mathfrak{1}}$, $P_{a}^{\mathfrak{21}\mathcal{L}}$ and $P_{a}^{\mathfrak{22}\mathcal{L}}$ are the same.

\subsubsection{The Timing of {\vwarm}}
We first compare the performance of  conditional {\vwarm} with less {\vwarm} and more {\vwarm} strategies.
 Followed we investigate the relationship on the performance between conditional {\vwarm} and general {\vwarm} strategy.
  Finally, we estimate whether the conditional {\vwarm} has the optimal performance in  commodity computer systems.

  We denote the extra cost introduced by {\vdelay} and {\vwarm} as
    $T_{delay}$ and $T_{warm}$, respectively.
$T_{delay} = T_{W}-T_{NM}$ is constant for different executions.
    $T_{warm}$ depends on the number of loaded cache lines of table entries.

%Then we have the following theorems.
\paragraph{comparing conditional \vwarm~ with less \vwarm~}
By comparing the expected extra time introduced due to the two strategies, we can get the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}\label{lemma:warmnum1}
  The conditional {\vwarm} strategy has better performance than the less {\vwarm} strategy.
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
The expected extra time introduced by less {\vwarm} and conditional {\vwarm}  are denoted as $E(T^{\ominus})$ and $E(T)$, respectively.
In the state $S_{\bar{c}, a}$, the {\vdelay} operation is needed,
so the extra time introduced by {\vwarm} is concealed in the {\vdelay} operation.
 In the state $S_{c}$ and $S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}$, {\vwarm} and {\vdelay} are not needed for this two strategies.
The difference between the expected extra time introduced by less {\vwarm} and conditional {\vwarm} is:
%\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:tpc1}
E(T^{\ominus})-E(T)=\Pi_{\bar{c}, a}^{\ominus} * T_{delay} - \Pi_{\bar{c}, a} * T_{delay}
\end{equation}

And then, we get that $E(T^{\ominus}) > E(T)$ for all $P_{warm}^{\ominus}\in(0,1)$.
So the extra time introduced by less {\vwarm} strategy is always larger than conditional {\vwarm} strategy. That is the conditional {\vwarm} strategy has better performance than the less {\vwarm} strategy.
\end{IEEEproof}

\paragraph{Comparing conditional \vwarm~ with more {\vwarm}}
By comparing the expected extra time introduced due to the two strategies, we can get the following theorem.
First we denote:
\begin{align}
&G = T_{delay} / T_{warm}\ , \nonumber \\
&M = T_{warm_{min}} / T_{delay}\ ,  \nonumber \\
&D_{R}=P_{evict|S_{c}}(P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}-P_{evict|S_{c}}P_{access|S_{c}})(P_{access|S_{c}}-1) \nonumber \\
   & \ \ \ \ +M(1-P_{evict|S_{c}})P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}(P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}+P_{evict|S_{c}}(1-P_{access|S_{c}}))\ , \nonumber \\
&R = \frac{P_{evict|S_{c}}(P_{access|S_{c}}-1)(P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}}+P_{evict|S_{c}}(1-P_{access|S_{c}}))}{D_{R}}\ . \nonumber
\end{align}

%Let $g = T_{delay} / T_{warm}$ and $M = T_{warm_{min}} / T_{delay}$.
%We denote $P_{evict}(P_{a}^{\mathfrak{2}}-P_{evict}P_{a}^{\mathfrak{1}})(1-P_{a}^{\mathfrak{1}})-M(1-P_{evict})P_{a}^{\mathfrak{2}}(P_{a}^{\mathfrak{2}}+P_{evict}(1-P_{a}^{\mathfrak{1}}))$ as $G_D$.
%We denote $\frac{P_{evict}(1-P_{a}^{\mathfrak{1}})(P_{a}^{\mathfrak{2}}+P_{evict}(1-P_{a}^{\mathfrak{1}}))}{G_D}$ as $G_e$.
\begin{theorem}\label{lemma:warmnum2}
%If $P_{evict}\leq \frac{M*P_{a2}}{1-P_{a1}}$,
%    conditional {\vwarm} strategy has better performance than the less {\vwarm} strategy;
%or if $P_{evict} > \frac{M*P_{a2}}{1-P_{a1}}$,
%    conditional {\vwarm} strategy has better performance than the less {\vwarm} strategy when $g<g_{max}$,
%        where
%\begin{equation}
%\label{equ:kzero}
%g_{max} = \frac{P_{evict}(1-P_{a1})(P_{a2}+P_{evict}P_{a2}+P_{evict}(1-P_{a1}))}{(P_{evict}P_{a2}+P_{a2}-P_{evict}P_{a1})(P_{evict}(1-P_{a1})-MP_{a2})-MP_{evict}P_{a2}}
%\end{equation}
% \end{theorem}
Conditional {\vwarm} strategy has better performance than the more {\vwarm} strategy if the following condition
 is satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    $\forall D_{R}$, when  $D_{R} < 0$, $G < \min(R)$.
\end{itemize}

\end{theorem}

\begin{IEEEproof}
The process of proof is the same as Theorem~\ref{lemma:warmnum1} that comparing $E_{T}$ with $E_{T}^{\oplus}$. The details are in Appendix~\ref{appendixa}.
\end{IEEEproof}

\paragraph{comparing conditional \vwarm~ with general warm strategy}
By comparing the expected extra time introduced by the two strategies, we can get the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{lemma:warmnum3}
    Performing {\vwarm} when some cache misses occur during the previous execution of encryption results in the least extra time of {\vwarm} and {\vdelay},
if the following condition is satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    $\forall D_{R}$, when  $D_{R} < 0$, $G < \min(R)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{IEEEproof}
Firstly, we consider an extreme case that is performing {\vwarm} with a probability $P_{warm}^{\odot}\in[0,1]$ just when cache misses do not occur during the pervious execution of encryption while not performing {\vwarm} when cache misses occur. This case is denoted as complementary {\vwarm}.
%In this case, when there is a cache miss in the previous, {\vdelay} is needed. If the next encryption accesses any entry that is currently not in caches, performing {\vwarm} before hand introduces non extra overhead.
% However, if not performing {\vwarm},
%   the extra time introduced by {\vdelay} is listed in Table\ref{tbl:warmcontent}.
%  %as proved in Theorem~\ref{theorm:warmall},
%   %when some cache line size of lookup tables are not cached, not performing {\vwarm} introduces more extra time.
% Further more, complementary {\vwarm} strategy will introduce extra overhead when cache misses no occur. Therefore complementary {\vwarm} strategy has less performance than conditional {\vwarm}.
%On the other hand, the Markov state transition diagram of complementary {\vwarm} is in \figurename~\ref{fig:cocase}.
%Using the same calculation process within Theorem~\ref{lemma:warmnum1},
% we can get that conditional {\vwarm} strategy has better performance than complementary {\vwarm} strategy.
It can be proved that conditional {\vwarm} strategy has better performance than complementary {\vwarm} strategy using the same method as in Theorem~\ref{lemma:warmnum1}.

Generally,
 general warm strategy can be divided into the combination of less {\vwarm}, more {\vwarm} and complementary {\vwarm}.
  We denote the general warm strategy as $W$. In $W$, performing {\vwarm} with a probability $P_{1}\in[0,1]$  when a cache miss occurs during the pervious execution of encryption while performing {\vwarm} with a probability $P_{2}\in[0,1]$ in other conditions.
   Similarly, we denote less {\vwarm} strategy, more {\vwarm} strategy and complementary {\vwarm} as $W_{L}$, $W_{M}$ and $W_{Co}$.
  Then we can get the equation:
  \begin{equation}
W = x_{1}W_{L}+x_{2}W_{M}+x_{3}W_{Co}
\end{equation}
  where $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$ and $x_{3}$ satisfy:
$$\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&x_{2}P_{warm}^{\oplus}+x_{3}P_{warm}^{\odot}=P_{2} \\
&x_{1}P_{warm}^{\ominus}+x_{2}=P_{1} \\
&x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=1
\end{aligned}
\right..
$$

In this way, the general warm strategy is divided. It is already proved that conditional {\vwarm} has the best performance compared with less {\vwarm} strategy and complementary {\vwarm}. Meanwhile if satisfied the condition in Theorem~\ref{lemma:warmnum2}  conditional {\vwarm} has better performance compared with more {\vwarm} strategy.
So conditional {\vwarm} has better performance than general warm strategy for any $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$,
if condition:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item
%    $GDenominator \leq 0$;
%  \item
%    or if $GDenominator > 0$, $g$ is smaller than the minimum value of $Gexpression$.
%\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    $\forall D_{R}$, when  $D_{R} < 0$, $G < \min(R)$.
\end{itemize}
 is satisfied.
That is  performing {\vwarm} when some cache misses occur during the previous execution of encryption results in the least extra time of {\vwarm} and {\vdelay}.
\end{IEEEproof}


%\begin{IEEEproof}
%%We cannot directly determine or predict whether the lookup tables are in the cache or not. Therefore, we can only decide whether to perform the {\vwarm}  operation based on the time of the previous execution. %As we just proved, whenever we perform \vwarm, we will load all lookup tables into cache.
%In order to prove Theorem \ref{lemma:warmaftermiss}, we compare it with two cases:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item When there is a cache miss in the previous AES execution, we perform  {\vwarm}  with a probability less than 1.
%  \item Performing {\vwarm} operation with a probability $P_{warm}$, regardless of the cache state after the previous execution.
%\end{itemize}
%
% Denote this strategy as \emph{probabilistic \vwarm}, while our scheme as \emph{conditional \vwarm}.
%
%
%We use the Markov model to analyse both \emph{probabilistic \vwarm}~and \emph{conditional \vwarm}.

%We use $\Pi_{full}^{p}$ ($\Pi_{full}^{c}$), $\Pi_{nonas}^{p}$ ($\Pi_{nonas}^{c}$), $\Pi_{as}^{p}$ ($\Pi_{as}^{c}$) to represent the limit distribution of the three states  when the Markov chain in stable state for the probabilistic and conditional {\vwarm}  respectively, and the values are as follows.

%\paragraph{comparing conditional \vwarm~ with general warm strategy}
\begin{corollary}
For the AES-128 implementation with a 2KB lookup table
in commodity computer systems,
performing  {\vwarm}  when cache-miss occurs during the previous execution,
  results in the least extra time of {\vdelay} and {\vwarm}.
\end{corollary}

\begin{IEEEproof}
For the AES-128 implementation with a 2KB lookup table, $P_{access|S_c}$ is larger than 0.994 from Equation~\ref{equ:delay}.
The range of $P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}}$ is $[0.994,1]$.
For the Lenovo ThinkCentre M8400t PC with an Intel Core i7-2600 CPU and 2GB RAM,
$T_{delay}$ is $2479.00$ cycles;
the minimum of $T_{warm}$($T_{warm_{min}}$) is $124$ cycles when accessing the lookup table from L1D caches;
and the maximum of $T_{warm}$ is $1781.60$ cycles when all the lookup entries are not cached.
Thus, $M=0.0491$ and the rang of $G$ is $[1.39,19.99]$.


%
%In Equation~\ref{equ:kzero}, if we regard $g_{max}$ as the function of $P_{a1}$, we can get that $g_{max}$ is a monotony increase function when $P_{a1}$ is larger than 0.994.
%That is when $P_{a1} = 0.994$, $g_{max}$ gets the minimum value.
%Also if we regard $g_{max}$ as the function of $P_{evict}$, we can get that $g_{max}$ is a monotony decrease function when when $P_{a1}$ is larger than 0.994.
%In the same way, if we regard $g_{max}$ as the function of $P_{a2}$, when $P_{evict}$ is small, $g_{max}$ is a monotony increase function. But when $P_{evict}$ is large, $g_{max}$ is a monotony decrease function.
%Therefore, the minimum value of $g_{max}$ is 40.3 when $P_{evict} = 1$, $P_{a1} = 0.994$ and $P_{a2} = 1$.
%The max value of $g$ is less than the minimum value of $g_{max}$, that is $g < g_{max}$.
%So according to Theorem~\ref{lemma:warmnum3}, performing  {\vwarm}  when cache-miss occurs during the previous execution results the minimum extra time

In this environment, when $D_{R} < 0$, $R$ is a monotonous increasing function of $P_{access|S_c}$.
$R$ gets the minimum value when $P_{access|S_c} = 0.994$.
Substitute the value into the equation~\ref{equ:g} and get:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{split}
&P_{evict|S_c} = \frac{0.994M(1-P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}})+\sqrt{\Delta}}{0.006(1-0.006M)} \\
&P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}} = \frac{0.07746P_{evict|S_c}}{\sqrt{M(1-P_{evict|S_c})}}-0.006P_{evict|S_c} \\
& if\  P_{evict|S_c} >1, P_{evict|S_c} = 1 \\
& if\  P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}} >1, P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}} = 1
\end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
\Delta = &0.988036M^2- 1.976072M^{2}P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}} \nonumber \\
&+(0.006M+ 0.988M^2)(P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}})^{2} \nonumber
\end{align}

By computation we get that when $P_{evict|S_c} = 1$, $P_{S_{\bar{c}, a}|S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}} = 1$ and $P_{access|S_c} = 0.994$, $R$ gets the minimum value.
The minimum value is $167.7$.
Therefore, $G$ is smaller than the minimum value of $R$ when $D_R < 0$.
 So based on Theorem~\ref{lemma:warmnum3} performing  {\vwarm}  when cache-miss occurs during the previous execution,
  results in the least extra time of {\vdelay} and {\vwarm}.
\end{IEEEproof}

%In the above proof, we treated AES as one atomic operation and excluded some special situations. In reality, the AES execution can be interrupted. We did not consider the cases such as when the process scheduling and interruption occur during the AES. These conditions will be discussed later.%这里我是想说，在上面的这个证明里面，我们将AES过程当做了一个黑盒子，也就是一个原子操作。因此，我们有两种情况没有考虑，1是没有考虑中断或者调度发生在AES过程中，2是没有考虑周期调度函数执行，但并未发生调度。这两个情况将会在后面进行论证。在这里需要说明一下么？
\subsection{Additional Remarks}
%$S_{\bar{c}, a}$ and $S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}$
%\noindent\textbf{One AES execution is a partial warm operation.}
\subsubsection{One AES execution is a partial warm operation}
When the system is in the state $S_{\bar{c}, a}$, one AES execution is a partial warm operation, as in this case, cache misses are resulted to load the corresponding entries into the cache.

%下面注释掉的这段是之前的证明，但是现在看来似乎是不需要了。
%Here, we prove that the extra time caused by not performing the \verb+warmup+ operation after an AES execution at the state $S_{as}$, is larger than our scheme. The probability that the next consecutive AES execution needs \verb+delay+ when $N$ cache line size of the lookup tables are in the cache before the AES execution (i.e.,  partial \verb+warmup+) is shown in Equation~\ref{equ:delay}, while the introduced extra time $T_{delay,N} = P_{delay,N} * t_{delay}$. The extra time $T_{warm,N}$ for our scheme is used to access all the lookup tables, including the ones in and not in the cache, and is shown in Equation~\ref{equ:partwarm}, where $t_c$ ($t_{nc}$) is the time for accessing one cache line that is in (not in) the cache. Evaluations on different platforms show that  $T_{delay,j} > T_{warm,j}$ for $j = 0, 1, ..., 67$.
%For example, in the environment described in Section~\ref{sec:eval}, $t_c = 5.01$, $t_{nc}=36.62$, $t_{delay}=4287$, the $T_{delay,j}$  and $T_{warm,j}$ are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:partwarm}.
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{equ:partial}
%P_{delay,j} = \sum_{i=0}^{68-j}C_{68-j}^{i}(1-P_e)^{i}P_e^{68-j-i}(1-P_e^{68-i-j})
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{equ:partwarm}
%T_{warm,j} = \sum_{i=0}^{68-j}C_{68-j}^{i}(1-P_e)^{i}P_e^{68-j-i}((i+j)t_c+(68-i-j)t_{nc})

%In our analysis, the warmup operation is performed after the AES execution. When doing the delay operation, the time consumption of the warmup operation is included in the delay time. So it is better to perform warmup when need to delay because the warmup cost nothing at this time.%这段话是想说，warm是在delay之后做的，而且warm的消耗包含在了delay的消耗里，所以只要需要进行delay的时候，进行一次warm是一个更好的选择，因为这个时候warm是不会产生额外消耗的。这段话放在这里似乎不太合适，但我没想好放在哪里。

When the system state is $S_{\bar{c}, a}$, conditional {\vwarm} strategy performs {\vwarm}  with probability 1,
 while the general warm strategy performs {\vwarm} with a probability $P_{1}^{'}\in[0,1]$ greater than $P_{1}$, due to partial warm by the AES execution.
%, it mean the AES expands the $P_{warm}$.
However, the condition that makes $E(T^{\mathcal{W}}) > E(T)$ hold is not changed.
 Moreover based on Theorem~\ref{lemma:warmnum3}, although $P_{1}^{'}$ is different, the general warm strategy still can be divided. So
Therefore, conditional {\vwarm} strategy still  has better performance.


%the value of $P_{warm}$ doesn't affect the result. Although the AES expends the probability of warm, our scheme is better.
%When in the state $S_{as}$, for our conditional warmup method, we perform the warmup method. For probabilistic warmup method, originally performing the warmup operation is in a probability of $P_{warm}$. But now as the AES is a partial warmup operation, it mean the AES expands the $P_{warm}$. However, in the proof of Theorem 4, the value of $P_{warm}$ doesn't affect the result. Although the AES expends the probability of warm, our scheme is better.%这段话就是在解释AES本身是一个部分warm的过程。但是在现在的方案中，这个部分warm的效果，在我们的方案中没有体现，而在概率warm的情况下，效果就是提高了warm的概率。而我们在上面的证明过程中，得到了我们方案最优，是和概率warm的大小无关的，也就是说，这种情况下还是我们的方案更优。
%之前做的证明，是因为当时的方案是warm是在AES之前进行，所以warm执行不执行是会有时间开销的，所以是对warm开销和delay开销的一个比较。但现在，warm是没有开销的。所以把这段注释掉了。

%\noindent\textbf{Process scheduling and interruption occur during the AES execution.}
\subsubsection{Process scheduling and interruption occur during the AES execution}
In this case,  $t2 - t1 > T_{W}$, {\vwarm}  will be triggered in our scheme. %As proved in Theorem 2, we don't perform delay operation. So if we perform the warmup operation, it will bring extra overhead.
As the process scheduling and interruption occur, we assume that $N$ cache lines of lookup tables are evicted from caches.
%We assume that after this AES, there are $N$ cache line size of lookup tables not in the cache.
Hence, the extra overhead introduced by using {\vwarm}  to load all lookup tables is $E(T_{warm},N) = N T_{cl} + (32-N)*T_{c}$, where $T_c$ and $T_{cl}$ denote the time for accessing one cache line from caches and RAM, respectively. If we do not perform \vwarm , the next round of AES may need to access part(s) of lookup tables from RAM instead of caches, which will trigger \vdelay. The expected overhead is $D_{nl}(N)$ (Equation~\ref{equ:tdelay}).
Table~\ref{tbl:scheduaes} shows that performing {\vwarm} achieves better performance when $N>0$. If $N = 0$, it means that the lookup tables are not evicted from the cache when the process scheduling and interruption occur. In this case {\vwarm} is not need. However from the overall execution we cannot distinguish whether the lookup tables are evicted. Thus performing {\vwarm} introduces some extra overhead.
%If not performing the warmup operation, the probability of needing delay is $P_{delay}$, and the extra time introduced is $T_{delay}$ as shown in Equation~\ref{equ:delay} and Equation~\ref{equ:tdelay}.
%So from Table~\ref{tbl:scheduaes}, we find that in this case, performing warmup operation is better.%这段是说明了调度和中断发生在AES执行过程中的情况。这时的warm是有额外开销的，比较这时使用warm的开销和不使用warm时会产生的delay的开销。得出此时使用warm是更好的。

%\noindent\textbf{Periodical schedule function is called without scheduling during AES execution.}
\subsubsection{Periodical schedule function is called without scheduling during AES execution}
As no other process invoked, the lookup table is not evicted.
Therefore, {\vwarm}   is unnecessary although $T_{NM} < t2 - t1 \leq T_{W}$.
However, {\vwarm}   is a better choice, as we cannot predict whether the lookup table is in the cache, and the overhead introduced by accessing the elements in caches is concealed by \vdelay.

%In this case, the lookup tables normally are still in the cache. So the warmup and delay operation are not needed. Actually, in this case, $T_{NM} < end - start \leq T_{W}$. However, we can't distinguish it is in this case or cache misses occurs. So we must do the delay operation. Moreover, in this case, performing warmup operation introduces none extra time. Therefore, we can regard this case as in the state $S_{as}$. %这段话是说明了周期调度函数调用但未有其他函数被调度时，AES时间是小于WET的，但是我们通过观察无法分辨是这种情况发生，还是是有cache miss发生。因此我们要对这种情况进行delay+warm的操作。其实对于概率warm的情况，也是要这么处理，所以，我们的方案合适。

%\noindent\textbf{The relationship between the cache state and execution time.}
\subsubsection{The relationship between the cache state and execution time}
In the above, we prove that performing  {\vwarm}  when not all lookup entries are in caches, results the smallest extra time.
However, in our scheme, we perform the {\vwarm} operation according to the previous AES execution time,
 as we are technically unable to observe the cache state without introducing additional overhead.
% \footnote{Otherwise, we perform  the warmup operation before each execution, which is less efficient as proved in Theorem 4.}.% 这个脚注是什么意思？为什么？
The relation between the cache state and execution time is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t2 - t1 \leq T_{NM}$, the system is in state $S_{c}$ or $S_{\bar{c},\bar{a}}$, no {\vwarm} is needed according to Theorem~\ref{lemma:warmnum3}.
  \item $t2 - t1 > T_{W}$, the system is in state $S_{c}$, $S_{\bar{c}, a}$ or $S_{\bar{c}, \bar{a}}$, {\vwarm}   is needed according to Theorem~\ref{theorm:warmall}.
 % another process is scheduled during the AES execution which makes part of the lookup tables  evicted from the cache.
  \item $T_{NM} < t2 - t1 \leq T_{W}$, %all the lookup tables may be in the cache or not, which is related with the workload in parallel.
%      The OS invokes the \verb+Scheduler()+ function every $t_{sched}$ interval and evicts at least one  entry of the lookup tables for anther process with the probability $P_{evict}$. Then, in this case,
%      when performing \verb+warmup+ for the AES execution next to the current one, the expected extra time is $T_{warm}^{t-w} = ( \frac{encEnd_c-encStart_c}{t_{interval}}*(1-P_{evict})+ \frac{encStart_c-encStart_p}{t_{interval}}*P_{evict}) * t_{warm}$;
%       while not performing the \verb+warmup+, the expected extra time is $T_{delay}^{t-w} = \frac{encStart_c-encStart_p}{t_{interval}}*P_{evict} * t_{delay}$. When $P_{evict}$ satisfies Equation~\ref{equ:con}, $T_{warm}^{t-w} < T_{delay}^{t-w}$, which means the \verb+warmup+ operation is not needed when the workload is small. In our evaluation environment, we find that when $P_{evict} < 0.18$, the \verb+warmup+ operation is unnecessary.
    %all the lookup tables may be in the cache or not.
    the system is in the state $S_{\bar{c}, a}$ or $S_{c}$, {\vwarm}   is better according to previous analysis. %the periodic schedule function is called but scheduling not occurs during AES execution. But we treat them all as in the state $S_{as}$. On the above we already explain it reasonable.%这里就是说，这里对应两种情况，但是都只能当S_{as}这个状态来处理，但是之前已经说明过了，这样是没问题的。

%Moreover, as proved in Lemma 3, the \verb+warmup+ operations  are necessary  to provide better performance in the following two  cases where  not all the lookup tables are in the cache:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Before the first AES execution, where none of the lookup tables are in  cache.
%  \item The interval between two AES executions is too large or perform AES discontinuously. %在AES不连续的时候，建议进行warm操作。

\subsection{Different Key Lengths and Implementations}

All the theorems above still stand, with the only difference being the value of $P_{access}$,$T_{warm}$ and $T_{delay}$.
The {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme provides the optimal performance for various implementations of AES~\cite{openssl,polarssl} with different key length, if the conditions in previous theorems are satisfied.
$P_{a}$ (detailed in Appendix~\ref{appendixb}) is the probability that some cache line size of lookup tables not in the cache are accessed. It depends  on the structure and size of lookup tables and the number of iterated rounds.
For mbed TLS-1.3.10~\cite{polarssl} and OpenSSL-0.9.7i~\cite{openssl}, they have 5 lookup tables with the total size 4.25KB and 5KB. For OpenSSL-1.0.2c~\cite{openssl}, the size of lookup tables is 4KB or 2KB. The number of rounds is 10, 12 and 14 for AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256,respectively.
Table~\ref{tbl:pdelayvalue} lists the corresponding minimum $P_{access}$.
$T_{warm}$ and $T_{delay}$ are related to not only the different implementations and key length, but also the platform that running AES.
Therefore, for different implementations and key length of AES, first we should determine $P_{access}$, $T_{warm}$ and $T_{delay}$. Then we can use the previous theorems to determine whether the {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme provides the optimal performance.
 Furthermore, the {\vwarm} and {\vdelay} can be configured to satisfy the theorems then get the optimal performance.


%We analyze three different AES implementations. The difference is in the last round of the AES. The first one uses a 256B table in the last round~\cite{polarssl}. The second one uses one 1KB table in the last round~\cite{openssl}(Openssl-0.9.7i), and the third one uses the four tables in the previous rounds~\cite{openssl}(Openssl-1.0.2c). Also we analyze the different key length of AES. AES-128 has 10 rounds, AES-192 has 12 round, and AES-256 has 14 rounds.%这是说，有三种AES实现，一种是使用5个查找表，前面几轮使用4个1K的表，最后一轮使用256B的一个表。一种是使用5个表，前几轮也是使用4个1K的表，但最后一轮使用1个1K的表。还有一种是使用4个1K的表，每轮都是使用这4个表。同时每种实现有分为三种密钥长度，每种密钥长度其实对应的是AES不同的轮数.

%For all the situations, the process of the proof of the Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 is almost the same. The main difference is the value of $P_{delay}$. We compute the value of $P_{delay}$ in the Table~\ref{tbl:pdelayvalue}, and find out that the Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 still hold true. %这段是说，对于这些不同的情况，在证明Lemma 3 and Lemma 4的时候，证明方法都是一样的，不同的就是P_{delay}的取值范围不同，但是经过计算，在每种取值范围内，Lemma 3 and Lemma 4都是成立的，也就是都是我们的方案最优。

For other table-lookup block ciphers, we have to determine $P_{access}$, $T_{warm}$ and $T_{delay}$ according to the algorithm, the implementation and the running platform.
Once the conditions in these theorems are satisfied , {\scshape{Warm+Delay}}  provides the optimal performance.

%it is similar to the AES. They just have different values of $P_{delay}$. The three states of the cache is same and they have the same state transition diagram. So it can be proved that the Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 hold true for them.% 这段是说，对于其他算法，Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 的证明也是类似的，同样对于cache有这三种状态，且状态转移图也是一样的，故而证明过程也一样，只是P_{delay}不同而已，可以证明对于其P_{delay}的范围，Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 也是成立的。
