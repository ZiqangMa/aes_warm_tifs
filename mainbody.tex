\begin{abstract}
%remote cache timing side channels危害很大；攻击的privilege要求很少。
%通用的防御就是warm和delay，有提出；但是至今没有被深入的研究。
%本文提出了Warm+Delay, a framework for symmetric algorithms to eliminating xxx.
% Then, we
Cache timing side channels allow a remote attacker to recover the cryptographic keys,
 by repeatedly invoking the encryption/decryption functions and measuring the execution time.
{\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}}, are two common countermeasures against remote cache-based timing side channels,
 by reading constant data into caches before cryptographic operations
  and inserting padding instructions after these operations, respectively.
These schemes destroy the relationship between the execution time
  and the cache misses/hits which are determined by the secret key,
  but introduces extra operations and performance overheads.
In this paper, we integrate these two schemes into a framework
 that adopts {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}}  complementarily.
The proposed {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} framework
  eliminates the remote cache timing side channels,
  and is applicable to any cryptographic algorithms and computing platforms.
More importantly,
 we apply this framework to AES, 
 and analyze that it achieves \emph{the optimal performance with the least extra operations}.
We implement this framework on Linux with Intel Core CPUs to protect AES.
Experimental results of the prototype show that,
(\emph{a}) the execution time does not reflect cache access,
 (\emph{b}) the {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} framework outperforms different integration strategies of warm and delay, and
(\emph{c}) it works without any privileged operations on the system.



%  Methods to defend against the cache side channel attacks are implemented a lot, but still exist some problems such as excess extra overhead, relying on hardware modification, non-portability etc.
%Also it can be used to all the symmetric encryption algorithms implemented with lookup tables. The basic idea of our scheme is to combine performing cache warm and adding time delay.
%Through reducing the context of cache warm and the time of delaying and eliminating the unnecessary cache warm and delay operation on the premise of guarantee security, we achieve the  performance.
% Our scheme is independent with algorithms so that it can be easily transplanted.
%We implement our scheme on AES. Through the contrast experiments it is further proved the security and the optimality of our scheme.
