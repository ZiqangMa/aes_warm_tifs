\begin{abstract}
%remote cache timing side channels危害很大；攻击的privilege要求很少。
%通用的防御就是warm和delay，有提出；但是至今没有被深入的研究。
%本文提出了Warm+Delay, a framework for symmetric algorithms to eliminating xxx.
% Then, we
Cache timing side channels allow a remote attacker to disclose the cryptographic keys,
 only by repeatedly invoking the encryption/decryption functions and measuring the execution time.
{\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}} are two common countermeasures against remote cache-based timing side channels,
 by reading constant data into caches before cryptographic functions
  and inserting padding instructions after these functions, respectively.
These countermeasures destroy the relationship between the execution time
  and the cache misses/hits which are determined by the secret key,
  but introduce extra operations.
However, the extra operations are sometimes unnecessary,
   and then bring great performance overheads.
In this paper, we integrate these two countermeasure into a scheme
 that adopts {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}} alternatively and  complementarily.
Before each encryption/decryption,
   the constant data are warmed into caches if the last cryptographic function invocation is not finished
     at the expected speed.
Because the effect of {\scshape{Warm}} may be broken by system activities,
   {\scshape{Delay}} plays as another line of defense: after each encryption/decryption,
     padding instructions are inserted if the execution time may be exploited to .
Moreover, when {\scshape{Delay}} is necessary,
 Warm are performed as inserted padding instructions, to further optimize the performance.
The proposed {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme
   effectively eliminates remote cache timing side channels,
  and is applicable to different block ciphers and computing platforms.
More importantly,
 we apply this scheme to AES,
 and analyze that it achieves \emph{the optimal performance with the least extra operations}.
We implement it on Linux with Intel Core CPUs to protect AES.
Experimental results of the prototype show that,
(\emph{a}) the execution time does not leak information about cache access,
 (\emph{b}) the scheme outperforms other different integration strategies of {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}}, and
(\emph{c}) the implementation works without any privileged operations on the system.



%  Methods to defend against the cache side channel attacks are implemented a lot, but still exist some problems such as excess extra overhead, relying on hardware modification, non-portability etc.
%Also it can be used to all the symmetric encryption algorithms implemented with lookup tables. The basic idea of our scheme is to combine performing cache warm and adding time delay.
%Through reducing the context of cache warm and the time of delaying and eliminating the unnecessary cache warm and delay operation on the premise of guarantee security, we achieve the  performance.
% Our scheme is independent with algorithms so that it can be easily transplanted.
%We implement our scheme on AES. Through the contrast experiments it is further proved the security and the optimality of our scheme.
