\begin{abstract}
%remote cache timing side channels危害很大；攻击的privilege要求很少。
%通用的防御就是warm和delay，有提出；但是至今没有被深入的研究。
%本文提出了Warm+Delay, a framework for symmetric algorithms to eliminating xxx.
% Then, we
Cache side channels allow a remote attacker
    to recover the cryptographic keys,
   by repeatedly invoking the encryption/decryption functions and measuring the execution time.
In this paper,
 we present {\scshape{Warm+Delay}}, a protection against remote cache timing side-channel attacks,
    which conditionally warms the caches by reading constant tables
      and also conditionally delays the executions.
With this protection,
the encryption/decryption execution time is always independent of data processed
 (i.e., keys and plaintexts/ciphertexts),
  which determines the cache access;
 so
  it is effective to eliminate remote cache timing side channels.
The {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme is algorithm-independent,
   and works without any privileged operations on the system.
We apply this scheme to AES, and analyze that it achieves the optimized performance.
Experimental results
    (\emph{a}) confirm the security, by examining the execution time which does not reflect the data cache access,
  and (\emph{b}) validate the optimization,
  by comparing it with different strategies of warm and delay.


%  Methods to defend against the cache side channel attacks are implemented a lot, but still exist some problems such as excess extra overhead, relying on hardware modification, non-portability etc.
%Also it can be used to all the symmetric encryption algorithms implemented with lookup tables. The basic idea of our scheme is to combine performing cache warm and adding time delay.
%Through reducing the context of cache warm and the time of delaying and eliminating the unnecessary cache warm and delay operation on the premise of guarantee security, we achieve the  performance.
% Our scheme is independent with algorithms so that it can be easily transplanted.
%We implement our scheme on AES. Through the contrast experiments it is further proved the security and the optimality of our scheme.
