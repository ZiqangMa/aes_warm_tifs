%remote cache timing side channels危害很大；攻击的privilege要求很少。
%通用的防御就是warm和delay，有提出；但是至今没有被深入的研究。
%本文提出了Warm+Delay, a framework for symmetric algorithms to eliminating xxx.
% Then, we
Cache timing side channels allow a remote attacker to disclose the cryptographic keys,
 by repeatedly invoking the encryption/decryption functions and measuring the execution time.
{\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}} are two algorithm-independent and implementation-transparent countermeasures
  against remote cache-based timing side channels.
% by reading constant data into caches before cryptographic functions
%  and inserting padding instructions after these functions, respectively.
They destroy the relationship between the execution time
  and the cache misses/hits which are determined by the secret key,
  but introduce extra operations
%  . However, the extra operations are sometimes unnecessary,
   and then bring remarkable performance overheads.
In this paper, we investigate the performance of cryptographic functions protected by {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}},
  and attempt to find the best strategy to integrate these two countermeasures
    with the optimal performance while effectively eliminate remote cache timing side channels.
To the best of our knowledge,
  this work is the first to systematically analyze the performance of
    integrating {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}} against cache side channels in commodity computer systems.
%
%we integrate these two countermeasure into a scheme  that adopts {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}} alternatively and  complementarily.
%
%Before each encryption/decryption,
%   the constant data are warmed into caches if the last cryptographic function invocation is not finished at the expected speed.
%Because the effect of {\scshape{Warm}} may be broken by system activities,
%   {\scshape{Delay}} plays as another line of defense: after each encryption/decryption,
%     padding instructions are inserted if the execution time may be exploited to extract the secret key.
%Moreover, when {\scshape{Delay}} is necessary,
% {\scshape{Warm}} is performed as a part of inserted padding instructions, to further optimize the performance.
%The proposed {\scshape{Warm+Delay}} scheme
%   effectively eliminates remote cache timing side channels,
%  and is applicable to different block ciphers and computing platforms.
%
We derive the optimization scheme to integrate {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}},
   and apply it to AES.
It is proven that,
   the integration scheme with appropriate parameters,
   achieves the optimal performance with the least extra operations.
Finally,
    we implement it on Linux with Intel CPUs. % to protect AES.
Experimental results confirm that,
(\emph{a}) the execution time does not leak information on cache access,
 (\emph{b}) the scheme outperforms other integration strategies of {\scshape{Warm}} and {\scshape{Delay}}, and
(\emph{c}) the implementation works without any privileged operations on the computer.
%  Methods to defend against the cache side channel attacks are implemented a lot, but still exist some problems such as excess extra overhead, relying on hardware modification, non-portability etc.
%Also it can be used to all the symmetric encryption algorithms implemented with lookup tables. The basic idea of our scheme is to combine performing cache warm and adding time delay.
%Through reducing the context of cache warm and the time of delaying and eliminating the unnecessary cache warm and delay operation on the premise of guarantee security, we achieve the  performance.
% Our scheme is independent with algorithms so that it can be easily transplanted.
%We implement our scheme on AES. Through the contrast experiments it is further proved the security and the optimality of our scheme.
